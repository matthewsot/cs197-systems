Initial Tasks
-------------

- Read https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06587
- Implement basic inclusion/exclusion solving in Python just to check
  correctness
- Check correctness of Python implementation against SAT-COMP benchmarks:
  http://www.satcompetition.org/
- Implement C version (start with parsing DIMACS, then enumerating
  k-combinations)
- Simultaneously, fork the Python version to estimate (think random!)
  performance of the incl/excl solver. Run this on SAT-COMP benchmarks,
  compared to miniSAT, and try to find some that we may have an advantage on.
- Optimize!
