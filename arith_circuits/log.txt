Initial Tasks
-------------

- Read https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/publications/papers/asplos13.pdf

- Python implementation of core technique (build depth-1, depth-2, ... circuits
  --- good idea David !)

- Think about how to speed things up. Parallel/distributed random search? Any
  good heuristics? Carry around evaluation on a point instead of whole circuit?
  Use SMT solvers?

- C/etc. implementation, and/or with optimizations
