---- Next steps
- For now, focus on the parameter-solving bit flip

---- Understanding the group's bit flip
- "noise levels in real life networks"
- "simulations + formal logic for end-to-end verification of both"

Eventual goal:
- Parameter solving
- Simulations for noise & such like in #6 but more general
- Cross-verifying algorithm & implementation
- Generating implementation
- Trying different encodings
