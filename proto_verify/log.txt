Extension Ideas
---------------
incl from below:
1. Synthesis, or at least solving for "best" param in a param'd protocol
2. Automate proofs for infinite timesteps
3. Handle multiple competing flows
4. Use symbolic abstraction to characterize 'good' initial states
5. Try to verify actual C implementations

#1 and #4 seem like good fits; can take the same encoding they use and just
throw in an optimization loop.

#2 is good to experiment with different encodings.

Initial Tasks
-------------

- Read https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3452296.3472912

- Pick a simple protocol (AIMD?) and try to match their results with Z3.

- Try different encodings. Particularly, try the infinite one in Vampire and an
  infinite one for LTL solvers.

- Think about how we might extend this. Possible directions: try to automate
  proofs for infinite timesteps, handle multiple competing flows, use symbolic
  abstraction to characterize 'good' initial states, or try to verify actual C
  implementations.
