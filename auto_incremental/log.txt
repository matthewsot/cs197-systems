- Read
  https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.4.8161&rep=rep1&type=pdf

- Download SAT-COMP benchmarks and identify possible candidates

- Parse the DIMACS, look for identical/isomorphic clause sets

- Call the incremental mode of the solver using those isomorphic clause sets,
  record and compare number of decisions (or some other metric)

- Decide how to build off here: infinite problem sets? more processing of the
  formulas?
